# Client Link Carousel - Comprehensive E2E Test Suite

## 🎯 Overview

This comprehensive End-to-End test suite validates the Client Link Carousel functionality at `/link/[code]` using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The tests focus on **what IS implemented** vs **what is NOT implemented**, providing clear identification of functionality gaps and implementation issues.

## 🏗️ Test Architecture

### Page Object Model (POM)
- **ClientLinkPage**: Main page object for carousel interactions
- **Comprehensive Selectors**: All UI elements properly identified
- **Action Methods**: Reusable actions for navigation, bucket assignment, modal interactions
- **Assertion Helpers**: Dedicated methods for verifying missing features

4. Add appropriate assertions for both positive and negative cases

### Updating Test Data
- Update `testLinkCode` variables in spec files with valid link codes
- Ensure test properties have proper data for comprehensive testing
- Update expected values based on actual application behavior

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    npm run dev &
    sleep 10  # Wait for server to start
    ./scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh all
    pkill -f "npm run dev"  # Stop dev server
```

## 📝 Contributing to Tests

When adding new features to the carousel:

1. **Update Page Object**: Add new selectors and methods to `ClientLinkPage`
2. **Add Feature Tests**: Create tests for new functionality
3. **Update Missing Features**: Remove from "missing" tests when implemented
4. **Performance Impact**: Add performance tests for new features
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure new features meet accessibility standards

## 🎓 Learning and Best Practices

### TDD Approach
1. **Red**: Write failing tests for desired functionality
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve implementation while keeping tests passing

### Test Organization
- **Arrange**: Set up test data and page state
- **Act**: Perform the user action
- **Assert**: Verify the expected outcome

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Use `--headed` mode to see browser actions
2. Add `page.screenshot()` at failure points
3. Use `page.pause()` for interactive debugging
4. Check browser console errors in test output

## 🏆 Conclusion

This comprehensive E2E test suite provides:

1. **Clear Visibility**: What is implemented vs what is missing
2. **Quality Assurance**: Thorough testing of existing functionality
3. **Performance Insights**: Identification of optimization opportunities
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards verification
5. **Future Roadmap**: Prioritized list of improvements needed

The test suite serves as both **validation** of current functionality and **specification** for future development, following TDD principles to guide implementation of missing features and improvements.

**Current Status**: Basic carousel functionality works well, but advanced features (CollectionOverview, BucketManager, VisitBooking) are missing and need implementation to provide a complete user experience.
