# Work Plan: SwipeLink Estate Production Readiness
**Date Created:** December 22, 2024 at 11:30 AM
**Estimated Timeline:** 5-7 days
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Production Blockers

## Executive Summary

This work plan addresses critical production blockers and system improvements needed to make SwipeLink Estate production-ready. Based on comprehensive code analysis, the platform is 70% complete but has critical gaps preventing deployment. This plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology and modular architecture guidelines.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths (What's Working)
- Agent Dashboard fully functional with property management
- Link creation and sharing system operational
- Analytics dashboard UI implemented with real-time hooks
- Swipe interface complete with gesture support
- CRM components built (90+ files) with proper README documentation
- Test infrastructure established with shared utilities

### Critical Gaps (Production Blockers)
1. **No Authentication System** - Anyone can access agent features
2. **Property Editing Broken** - Only logs to console instead of updating
3. **CRM Mock Data Only** - Services return fake data, no database persistence
4. **Advanced Components Disabled** - CollectionOverview, BucketManager, VisitBooking built but not active

### Technical Debt
- CRM module has files exceeding 200-line limit (5 type files, 5 components)
- Using links table for CRM instead of proper deals/tasks/contacts tables
- No task persistence layer (tasks exist only in memory)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security - Authentication System (Day 1-2)

#### Step 1.1: Create Authentication Database Schema
**Time:** 2 hours
**TDD Approach:** Write tests for database schema first

1. Write test for users table structure
2. Create migration file for users table with fields:
   - id (UUID primary key)

   - name (required)
   - role (agent, supervisor, admin)
   - created_at, updated_at timestamps
3. Write test for sessions table
4. Create sessions table for JWT token management
5. Run migration and verify with tests

#### Step 1.2: Implement Authentication Service
**Time:** 4 hours
**TDD Approach:** Test-first service development

1. Write failing tests for AuthService:
   - registerAgent(email, password, name)
   - loginAgent(email, password)
   - validateSession(token)

**TDD Approach:** Schema-first development

1. Write tests for CRM tables structure
2. Create deals table (replacing link-as-deal concept):
   - id, link_id, client_id, stage, value, probability
3. Create contacts table:
   - id, email, name, phone, preferences, engagement_score
4. Create tasks table:
   - id, deal_id, type, priority, due_date, status, assigned_to
5. Run migrations and verify

#### Step 4.2: Refactor CRM Services for Real Data
**Time:** 6 hours
**TDD Approach:** Service refactoring

1. Write tests for real data operations
2. Replace mock data returns in:
   - CRMService.getDeals() - fetch from deals table
   - TaskService.getTasks() - fetch from tasks table
   - ClientService.getClients() - fetch from contacts table
3. Implement data persistence methods
4. Add proper error handling
5. Update type definitions

#### Step 4.3: Connect CRM UI to Real Services

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Use established patterns (JWT, bcrypt)
   - Fallback: Implement basic auth, enhance later

2. **CRM Data Migration**
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption
   - Mitigation: Backup before migration, test thoroughly
   - Fallback: Keep mock data as fallback option

3. **Component Integration**
   - Risk: Advanced components break existing flow
   - Mitigation: Feature flag for gradual rollout
   - Fallback: Revert to basic components if issues

### Timeline Risks
- Buffer time included for unexpected issues
- Prioritize critical blockers first
- Can defer code quality improvements if needed
