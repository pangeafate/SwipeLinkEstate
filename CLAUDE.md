We are building the prototype of a service and want to test it locally first. All files are in the DevelopmentGuidelines folder. Always follow Test-Driven Development approach. 
Before building anything read the files below:
1. Read SWIPE-LINK-FULL-ARCHITECTURE-AND-MODULES. md to understand the service we want to build. 
2. Read  SWIPE-LINK-PROTOTYPE-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-FOR-CLAUDE-CODE. md to understand the scope of the prototype we will be building
3. Follow README-DRIVEN-DEVELOMENT.md to correctly develop application in a modular way
4. Follow TESTING-GUIDELINES.md to correctly develop the application in a test driven development approach
5. Follow DEPLOYMENT-GUIDELINES.md to understand how to deploy
6. See ACCESS-TO-REPOS-AND-TOOLS.md to get repositories and database credentials
