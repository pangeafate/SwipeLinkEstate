# BucketManager Component Module

## Overview
The BucketManager module provides comprehensive property organization functionality for the SwipeLink Estate platform. It has been refactored from a single 556-line file into a modular architecture with 6 focused components, each under 200 lines.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
BucketManager/
├── index.tsx                # Main orchestrator component (198 lines)
├── BucketNav.tsx           # Navigation tabs (103 lines)
├── BucketStatsDisplay.tsx  # Statistics display (62 lines)
├── PropertyGrid.tsx        # Property card grid (151 lines)
├── BucketControls.tsx      # Sort/filter controls (57 lines)
├── BucketActions.tsx       # Action buttons (45 lines)
└── types.ts                # Shared type definitions (68 lines)

## Components

### 1. BucketManager (Main Component)
**Purpose**: Orchestrates bucket management and coordinates sub-components.

**Responsibilities**:
- State management for sorting and filtering
- Drag and drop coordination
- Modal management
- Statistics calculation
- Component coordination

**Key Features**:
- Multi-bucket organization
- Drag and drop support
- Property sorting
- Modal dialogs
- Loading states

### 2. BucketNav
**Purpose**: Navigation tabs for switching between property buckets.

**Features**:
- Tab-based navigation
- Drag and drop targets
- Property counts per bucket
- Keyboard navigation

- ❌ Disliked - Properties user passed on
- 📋 All Properties - Complete collection view

### 3. BucketStatsDisplay
**Purpose**: Shows statistics for the active bucket.

**Statistics Displayed**:
- Average price
- Property type distribution
- Top locations
- Common features (bedrooms/bathrooms)

**Features**:
- Dynamic calculation
- Formatted display
- Tag-based visualization

### 4. PropertyGrid
**Purpose**: Displays grid of property cards with interactions.

**Features**:
- Responsive grid layout
- Drag and drop support
- Visit booking buttons
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Empty state handling
- Keyboard navigation

**Interactions**:
- Click to view property details
- Drag to reorganize buckets
- Book visits for liked properties

### 5. BucketControls
**Purpose**: Provides sorting and filtering options.

**Sort Options**:
- Date Added (Newest/Oldest)
- Price (High to Low/Low to High)
- Location (A-Z/Z-A)

**Filter Options**:
- Property Type (House/Condo/Townhouse)
- Price Range (Under $500K/$500K-$1M/Over $1M)

### 6. BucketActions
**Purpose**: Action buttons for bucket management.

**Actions**:
- 📄 Download Summary - Export bucket contents
- 📤 Share with Agent - Send to agent
- 🗑️ Clear Bucket - Remove all properties

## State Management

### Main Component State
```typescript
{
  showClearConfirmation: string | null  // Confirmation modal state
  showShareModal: boolean               // Share modal state
  sortBy: 'price' | 'date' | 'location' // Sort criteria
  sortOrder: 'asc' | 'desc'            // Sort direction
  dragging: string | null               // Currently dragging property ID
}
```

### Computed Values
```typescript
{
  activeProperties: Property[]  // Filtered by bucket
  bucketStats: BucketStats     // Calculated statistics
}
```

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { BucketManager } from '@/components/client/BucketManager'

function BucketPage() {
  const [activeBucket, setActiveBucket] = useState<BucketType | 'all'>('all')
  
  return (
    <BucketManager
      properties={properties}
      buckets={buckets}
      bookedVisits={visits}
      activeBucket={activeBucket}
      onBucketChange={handleBucketChange}
      onPropertySelect={handlePropertySelect}
      onBookVisit={handleBookVisit}
      onClearBucket={handleClearBucket}
      loading={isLoading}
    />
  )
}
```

## Drag and Drop Implementation

1. **Drag Start**: Property card becomes draggable
2. **Drag Over**: Bucket tabs highlight as drop zones
3. **Drop**: Property moves to new bucket
4. **Visual Feedback**: Dragging state and drop zone indicators

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Virtual Scrolling**: 
   - Renders only visible properties for 50+ items
   - Reduces DOM nodes and improves performance

2. **Memoized Calculations**:
   - Statistics computed only when properties change
   - Sorted lists cached until sort criteria changes

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Images load on demand
   - Deferred rendering for off-screen content

## Accessibility Features

- Full keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels and roles
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management
- High contrast support
- Tab navigation between buckets

## Mobile Optimization

- Touch-friendly drag and drop
- Responsive grid layout
- Simplified controls on small screens
- Optimized image loading
- Reduced visual complexity

## Testing Coverage

Each component has comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for drag and drop
- Accessibility compliance tests
- Performance benchmarks
- User interaction flows

## Migration Notes

This module was refactored from a single 556-line component to comply with the 200-line limit guideline. The refactoring achieved:
- Improved maintainability
- Enhanced testability
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier debugging
- Improved code reusability
- Modular architecture

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filtering**:
   - Multiple filter criteria
   - Custom filter presets
   - Search within buckets

2. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Select multiple properties
   - Bulk move between buckets
   - Batch visit booking

3. **Export Options**:
   - PDF reports
   - Excel spreadsheets
   - Email summaries

4. **Analytics**:
   - Time spent per property
   - Decision patterns
   - Preference insights
