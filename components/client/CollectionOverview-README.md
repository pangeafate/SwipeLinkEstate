# CollectionOverview Component

## Purpose
Displays a comprehensive overview of a property collection with statistics, visualizations, and interactive elements for the client link interface.

## Current Status
⚠️ **WARNING**: This component violates the 200-line limit with 669 lines. It needs to be refactored into smaller components.

## Architecture Position
Part of the client interface module, this component serves as a landing page view for property collections shared via links.

## Functionality
- Property collection statistics display
- Visual data representation (charts, graphs)
- Property grid preview
- Collection metadata
- Agent information display
- Share and export capabilities

## Component Structure
Currently monolithic, should be split into:
- CollectionStats (statistics cards)
- CollectionChart (data visualizations)
- CollectionGrid (property preview grid)
- CollectionHeader (metadata and actions)

## Data Flow
```
Link Access → CollectionOverview
                ├── Fetch collection data
                ├── Calculate statistics
                ├── Render visualizations
                └── Display property grid
```

## Props
- `linkCode`: Unique identifier for the collection
- `properties`: Array of properties in collection
- `agent`: Agent information
- `onPropertyClick`: Handler for property selection
- `onShare`: Share collection handler

## State Management
- Collection statistics (local state)
- View preferences (grid/list)
- Sort and filter options
- Export settings

## Performance Issues
- Large component size impacts load time
- Too many responsibilities in single component
- Difficult to test individual features
- Hard to maintain and debug

## Refactoring Plan
1. Extract statistics calculation to service
2. Create separate visualization components
3. Split grid into reusable component
4. Move share/export to utility module

## Dependencies
- React
- Property types
- Chart libraries (if used)
- Analytics service

## Known Issues
- Component too large (669 lines)
- Not currently integrated in production
- Missing proper test coverage
- Performance concerns with large datasets

## Future Improvements
- Implement virtual scrolling for large collections
- Add real-time updates
- Enhance mobile responsiveness
- Add print-friendly view
- Implement collection comparison
