# BehaviorTab Component

## Purpose
Behavioral analytics component that displays client activity patterns, engagement history, and interaction insights to help agents understand client behavior and optimize communication strategies.

## Architecture Context
BehaviorTab is an analytics-focused component within the ClientProfile tabbed interface that transforms client interaction data into actionable behavioral insights for enhanced relationship management.

```
ClientProfile → BehaviorTab → Activity Patterns Analysis
                           → Engagement History Metrics
                           → Recent Activity Timeline
                           → Behavioral Intelligence
```
