## State Management
Utilizes progressive profiling approach where client profiles evolve from "ghost" profiles to comprehensive records. Real-time updates through Supabase subscriptions with optimistic UI updates. Profile data cached with intelligent invalidation based on engagement activity.

## Progressive Profiling Architecture

The Client Service implements sophisticated progressive profiling that builds client understanding incrementally:

### Ghost Profile Stage (Initial Link Access)
When a client first accesses a property link, the system creates a "ghost profile":

**Initial Data Collection:**
- Anonymous session tracking
- Device and browser fingerprinting
- IP-based location approximation
- Referral source identification
- Initial property preferences from link content

**Behavioral Baseline Establishment:**
- Session interaction patterns
- Property viewing behavior
- Navigation preferences
- Time-of-day activity patterns
- Device usage characteristics

### Basic Profile Stage (First Interactions)
As clients interact with properties, the profile gains substance:

**Engagement Pattern Recognition:**
- Property like/dislike preferences
- Detail viewing behavior analysis
- Session duration and completion patterns
- Return visit behavior tracking
- Property feature interest identification

**Preference Learning Algorithms:**
- Property type affinity scoring
- Price range preference calculation
- Location preference mapping
- Feature importance weighting
- Style and aesthetic preference detection

### Enhanced Profile Stage (Multiple Sessions)
With continued engagement, the profile becomes predictively powerful:

**Advanced Behavioral Analysis:**
- Decision-making speed classification
- Budget flexibility assessment
- Timeline urgency indicators
- Communication style preferences
- Social influence patterns

**Market Intelligence Integration:**
- Competitive property comparison behavior
- Market timing sensitivity
- Price negotiation indicators
- Feature priority evolution
- Seasonal preference variations

### Complete Profile Stage (Client Identification)
When client identity is established, the profile reaches full capability:

**Comprehensive Client Intelligence:**
- Complete contact information
- Verified financial qualification
- Communication preference optimization
- Relationship history integration
- Cross-platform behavior synthesis

## Behavioral Intelligence Engine

## Property Preference Learning System

### Machine Learning-Powered Preference Detection

The Client Service employs sophisticated algorithms to detect and evolve property preferences:

**Property Type Affinity Scoring:**
```
Property Type Interest = (
  Interaction Frequency × Weight₁ +
  Time Spent Coefficient × Weight₂ +
  Detail View Ratio × Weight₃ +
  Return Visit Rate × Weight₄
) × Recency Factor
```

**Location Preference Mapping:**
- Geographic cluster analysis of preferred properties
- Commute time and transportation preference detection
- Neighborhood characteristic preference identification
- School district and amenity priority analysis
- Price-to-location sensitivity calibration

**Feature Importance Weighting:**
The system automatically identifies which property features matter most to each client:

**Must-Have Features:** Consistently present in liked properties
- High correlation with positive interactions
- Deal-breaker absence in rejected properties
- Strong preference consistency across sessions
- Priority ranking in decision matrix

**Nice-to-Have Features:** Moderate preference indicators
- Positive correlation but not consistent
- Enhancement value recognition
- Optional but appreciated characteristics
- Secondary decision factors

**Indifferent Features:** No clear preference signals
- Random distribution in property interactions
- Neutral impact on decision-making
- Background characteristics
- Non-factor in property evaluation

**Dislike Features:** Active avoidance patterns
- Negative correlation with property interest
- Quick rejection when present
- Consistent avoidance across sessions
- Filter-out criteria development

### Budget and Price Sensitivity Analysis

**Budget Range Detection:**
The system infers budget constraints from behavioral patterns rather than direct questions:

**Rigid Budget Indicators:**
- Consistent price range property interactions
- Immediate rejection of higher-priced options
- No aspirational property engagement
- Price-first filtering behavior

**Flexible Budget Indicators:**
- Wider price range exploration
- Occasional higher-price property interest
- Value-based evaluation over price-first
- Negotiation-open behavioral signals

**Aspirational Budget Indicators:**
- Consistent higher-price property interest
- Luxury feature engagement patterns
- Upgrade timeline behavioral signals
- Investment-oriented property evaluation
