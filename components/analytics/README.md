# Analytics Components

Components for analytics dashboard, metrics tracking, and data visualization.

## Overview

This directory is designated for analytics-related components that will provide insights into:
- Property viewing patterns
- Swipe behavior analytics
- Agent performance metrics
- User engagement tracking
- Real-time dashboard functionality

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development**

This module is currently empty and represents future functionality planned for implementation.

## Planned Components

### DashboardOverview
**Purpose**: Main analytics dashboard with key metrics  
**Planned Features**:
- Total properties viewed
- Swipe decision distribution
- Popular property types
- Geographic heat maps

### SwipeAnalytics  
**Purpose**: Detailed swipe behavior analysis
**Planned Features**:
- Swipe direction trends
- Time spent per property
- Abandonment rates
- Decision patterns

### PropertyMetrics
**Purpose**: Property-specific performance metrics
**Planned Features**:
- View counts per property
- Like/dislike ratios
- Time on market correlation
- Price point analysis

### RealTimeUpdates
**Purpose**: Live data updates and notifications
**Planned Features**:
- WebSocket integration
- Real-time metric updates
- Alert system for significant events
- Live user activity feed

### ReportGenerator
**Purpose**: Generate and export analytics reports
**Planned Features**:
- PDF report generation
- CSV data export
- Scheduled report delivery
- Custom date range analysis

## Architecture Considerations

### State Management
- Will use Zustand for global analytics state
- React Query for server state management
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connection

### Data Visualization
- Planned integration with Chart.js or D3.js
- Responsive charts and graphs
- Interactive data exploration
- Mobile-optimized visualizations

### Performance
- Implement data virtualization for large datasets
- Lazy loading of chart libraries
- Efficient data aggregation strategies
- Caching of computed metrics

## File Size Compliance
All future components will adhere to the 200-line maximum:
- Break complex visualizations into smaller chart components
- Use custom hooks for data fetching and transformation
- Separate chart configuration from rendering logic

## Dependencies (Planned)
- Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- date-fns for date manipulation
- WebSocket client for real-time updates
- File export utilities for reports

## Integration Points
- Swipe service for behavior tracking
- Property service for property metrics
- User session tracking
- Database analytics queries

## Future Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Basic dashboard with key metrics
2. **Phase 2**: Real-time updates and live data
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics and reporting
4. **Phase 4**: Predictive analytics and insights
